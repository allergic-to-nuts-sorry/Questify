# Questify
Questify is an innovative NLP application that generates questions in different formats such as multiple choice questions (MCQs), true or false statements, fill in the blanks, and matching exercises from a given text input. Questify is designed to help educators, trainers, and content creators save time and effort by automatically generating quiz questions based on the text.
The Questify application uses advanced natural language processing techniques such as text parsing, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging to extract relevant information and key concepts from the input text. Based on this analysis, Questify generates questions that test the reader's comprehension of the material.
MCQs are generated by presenting a question and a set of answer choices, including one correct answer and several distractors that are selected based on their relevance to the text. True or false statements are generated based on the information contained in the text, while fill-in-the-blank questions are created by removing a key word or phrase from a sentence.
Matching exercises are also included in Questify, allowing for the pairing of two sets of related items from the text, such as people and their accomplishments or events and their dates. Questify uses a combination of semantic analysis and pattern recognition to identify and match the appropriate pairs.
Questify is a powerful tool that helps educators and content creators assess the understanding of their students or audience without investing time in creating questions themselves. Questify saves time, ensures accuracy, and provides a unique way to test comprehension in a variety of formats.
